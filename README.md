# A little bit about me:

1. I love writing and reading stuff....
   that being said here is some answers that i wrote on quora....[my answers](https://www.quora.com/profile/Sriram-157) (read them at your own risk :grinning: :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: :grin:)

2. I have developed a new-found interest in **game development**.Now,as it requires I need to have a strong base in programming.Thus I want to avail the oppurtunities that have been provided in the form the **amazing** work done by technical clubs exclusive for coding.

3. Well....I guess the process has already begun,starting with GitHub.This **markdown** flavoured GitHub is amazing.

    ### You could quote people: 
    > All of my friends who have younger siblings,who are going to college or high school-my number of piece of advice is:**learn to program**
    > -Mark Zuckerberg
    
    and a lot more....
    
4. When it comes to the world of programming, Id like to go by the lines of Ygritte:  
    > You know nothing, Jon snow
    > -Ygritte
   (In my case its "You know nothing,Sriram" :grin:)
